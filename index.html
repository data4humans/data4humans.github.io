            <p>Data is born free and everywhere it is in chains<br>

        <h1>A Manifesto</h1>
        <p class="lead">Data is easy to get, tools are freely available, and code is simple to write. What’s missing is the human element. Finding the right data and using the right tool with the right code to answer the right questions becomes the challenge and this is where the human comes into play, often in the form of a data scientist, who crafts the data into knowledge and intelligence. The human gives context and meaning where there is none, making the data relevant and useful.</p>
        <p class="lead">
        While it may seem a mystical craft, the art of the data scientist is far easier than most understand and others are willing to admit. It begins with curiosity, which isn’t the purview of the few, but the birthright of the many who wonder about their world and the insights data can provide in answering those questions. The data scientist began as a curious onlooker to the stream of data being generated in our everyday lives and waded in to discover what lay beneath the surface. The path of the data scientist is one we all can walk.</p>
        <p class="lead">
        We believe all data can be tamed and made to tell it’s tale if there is a will to understand greater than the apathy that allowed the data to wallow in filth. We believe all tools can be mastered, even by the novice if there is a task critical enough to drive the spirit. We believe all code can be written if there is a problem that sufficiently fires the imagination. We believe the critical questions can be answered if there is a desire greater than our anxiety to master the craft of working with data. </p>
        <p class="lead">
        It begins with each of us and ends only when the last insight is wrung from the data we create. Join us.
